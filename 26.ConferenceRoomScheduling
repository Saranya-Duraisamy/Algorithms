Question: Given a set of meetings, assign them to conference rooms using the fewest rooms possible.

Input:

The input will be a set of `Meeting` objects, where each `Meeting` object has a `start` and `end` time. (Assume time is just an int!)
In Python, this might look something like:
    class Meeting(object):
      def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
        
    input = [
      Meeting(start=10, end=17),
      Meeting(start=23, end=30),
      Meeting(start=15, end=25),
    ]
Output

Return the minimal number of conference rooms needed to schedule all the meetings without overlap. The output should be a single number. 
For example, using the `input` defined above:

    >>> schedule(input)
    2
